Initially he was in Central Park Zoo in New York City but <b>escaped</b> and has been taking up residence in Central Park since then. Flaco`s escape <b>attracted</b> a lot of attention. People were <b>concerned</b> if he could live in wild nature and feed himself. But Flaco showed that he was able to. Flaco became a <b>celebrity</b> for New Yorkers. They signed a petition to let him stay free in Central Park. </div> <p>The Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo) usually resides in Eurasia and do not <b>inhabit</b> North America but there are few in zoos. It is a large owl which can weigh about 3 kg and the <b>wingspan</b> can reach 190 cm. Like most other owls, it is <b>nocturnal</b>. The bird has <b>distinctive</b> <b>ear tufts </b>and orange eyes. They are <b>predators</b> eating rats, rabbits, pigeons and even large insects. In wild nature they prefer to live in mountain areas where they can also build anest and raise their chicks. In the wild they can leave for up to 20 years. There were cases when these species lived around 60 years in a zoo. Healthy adults normally have nonatural predators, thus these owls are considered as <b>apex predators</b>. </p> <p>Flaco was taken to the Central Park zoo when he was about one year old and spent 12 years in <b>captivity</b>. His cage was a bus size with <b>fake</b> mountains and painted background.</p> <figure><img src=\"%HOSTNAME%/linguaroute/data/reading/articles/flaco-owl/flaco-test.png\" class=\"Article-center-image\" /> <figcaption class=\"Article-figcaption\">Flaco in Central Park</figcaption> </figure> <p>In February 2023 Flaco's <b>enclosure</b> was vandalized. Someone made a hole in the fence and Flaco escaped. After several weeks from his escape he was seen catching and eating his prey. Park officials tried to <b>recapture</b> Flaco with traps but he escaped them too. </p> <p>Zoo staff had concerns that Flaco would be able to fly and catch food for himself. But he successfully improved his flight and hunting <b>skills</b>. Later the staff made several attempts to capture him but Flaco proved he can learn and live in the wild, so they decided to let him stay free and monitor him ready to help if <b>necessary</b>. </p> <p>Flaco has faced many dangers including rat <b>poison</b>, traffic and window collision. Also he met a huge amount of Central Park inhabitants like squirrels and blue jays.</p> <figure><img src=\"%HOSTNAME%/linguaroute/data/reading/articles/flaco-owl/flaco-test.png\" class=\"Article-center-image\" /> <figcaption class=\"Article-figcaption\">Flaco in Central Park</figcaption> </figure> <div> <div> <figure><img src=\"%HOSTNAME%/linguaroute/data/reading/articles/flaco-owl/flaco-test.png\" class=\"Article-center-image\" /> <figcaption class=\"Article-figcaption\">Flaco in Central Park</figcaption> </figure> Officials and bird watchers criticized people for sharing the location of Flaco in social media as it leads to huge crowds of people following the bird. Also some people start to make noises and come too close to the bird. All these actions are against ethical guidelines for <b>birdwatching</b>. Flaco cannot have a good rest and time to recover after hunting. </div> <p>Flaco's story inspired people showing that even after years of a <b>dull life</b> you can start a new one learning skills and discovering a new environment for yourself.</p> </div> <h3 id=\"vocabulary\">Vocabulary</h3> <div> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><b>Word</b></td> <td><b>Transcription</b></td> <td><b>Meaning</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td>apex predators</td> <td>['eɪpeks] ['predətəs]</td> <td>высшие хищники; хищники, на которых в животном мире никто не охотится</td> </tr> <tr> <td>attract</a></td> <td>[ə'trækt]</td> <td> притягивать;привлекать,&nbsp;притягивать&nbsp;(внимание,инвестиции);завоёвывать,&nbsp;пленять,&nbsp;покорять,&nbsp;прельщать </td> </tr> <tr> <td>birdwatching</td> <td>[bɜːd'wɔʧɪŋ]&nbsp;</td> <td>наблюдение за птицами</td> </tr> <tr> <td>captivity</a></td> <td>[kæp'tɪvətɪ]</td> <td>пленж неволя</td> </tr> <tr> <td>celebrity</a></td> <td>[sə'lebrətɪ]</td> <td>известность, популярность, слава; знаменитый человек; знаменитость; звезда</td> </tr> <tr> <td>concern</a></td> <td>[kən'sɜːn]&nbsp;</td> <td>проблема; волновать</td> </tr> <tr> <td>distinctive</td> <td>[dɪ'stɪŋktɪv]</td> <td>отличительный, характерный</td> </tr> <tr> <td>dull life</td> <td>[dʌl] [laɪf]</td> <td>скучная, монотонная жизнь; безрадостная жизнь</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ear tufts&nbsp;</td> <td>[ɪə] [tʌfts]</td> <td>хохолки над ушами</td> </tr> <tr> <td>enclosure</td> <td>[ɪn'kləuʒə]</td> <td>огороженное место</td> </tr> <tr> <tr> <td>escape</td> <td>[ɪs'keɪp]</td> <td>бежать, совершать побег</td> </tr> <tr> <tr> <td>fake</td> <td>[feɪk]</td> <td>поддельный, фальшивый</td> </tr> <tr> <td>inhabit</td> <td>[ɪn'hæbɪt]</td> <td>жить, обитать</td> </tr> <tr> <td>necessary</td> <td>['nesəs(ə)rɪ]</td> <td>необходимый, нужный, требуемый</td> </tr> <tr> <td>nocturnal</td> <td>[nɔk'tɜːn(ə)l]</td> <td>активный в ночное время; способный видеть в темноте</td> </tr> <tr> <td>poison</td> <td>['pɔɪz(ə)n]</td> <td>яд, отрава</td> </tr> <tr> <td>predator</td> <td>['predətə]</td> <td>хищник</td> </tr> <tr> <td>recapture</td> <td>[ˌriː'kæpʧə]</td> <td>вернуть обратно</td> </tr> <tr> <td>skill</td> <td>[skɪl]</td> <td>навык, искусство, мастерство</td> </tr> <tr> <td>wingspan</td> <td>['wɪŋspæn]</td> <td>размах крыла</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id=\"questions\">Questions</h3> <p>Check your understanding answering the questions</p> <ul> <li>What happened to Flaco?</li> <li>Why did they try to catch Flaco?</li> <li>Why does Flaco's story inspire some people?</li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class=\"Article-right\"><b>On this page</b> <li><a href=\"#vocabulary\">Vocabulary</a></li> <li><a href=\"#questions\">Questions</a></li> </div> </div>"
